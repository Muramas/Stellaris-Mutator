# Stellaris-Mutator
A mod with the aim to make MP stellaris more enjoyable by trying different solutions to issues commonly found in stellaris.


# Test In Progress
- All stars have energy
- All 2 mineral orbitals are 3
- Change gene tailoring cost. Remove base cost and increase cost per pop.
- Stratified Society faction is happy, even if you have robots (Ghost73)
- Demoting pops faster (Rulers 3600 / specialist 1800 -> 360 days)
- You need more tech in the current tier before moving up Tier 2 = 10, Tier 3 = 10, Tier 4 = 7, Tier 5 = 6
- When you have an SR in your territory, the tech shows up more often. Also having an leader with the trait expertise materials also helps more (Fixed an issue with a NOT where it should be a NOR)

# Tests To-Do
- Federation status without fed fleet
- Stations giving speed aura (Create component_sets for "Station Aura", make an component_template for the "speed aura", create a starter tech for speed aura, make the "station aura" a required component on stations.)
- Remove Defense platoform upkeep


# Future Tests - Need more knowledge
- Setup a VS arena map (Test run complete but won't load with 2.2 due to tile changes)
- Modify wormhole tech to be researchable after seeing a wormhole
