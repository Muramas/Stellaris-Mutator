# Test In Progress
- All stars have 2 energy oribtals
- All 2 mineral orbitals are 3
- Change gene tailoring cost. Remove base cost and increase cost per pop.
- Stratified Society faction is happy, even if you have robots (Ghost73)
- Demoting pops faster - Rulers 3600 / specialist 1800 -> 360 days
- You need more tech in the current tier before moving up Tier 2 = 10, Tier 3 = 10, Tier 4 = 7, Tier 5 = 6
- When you have an SR in your territory, the tech shows up more often. Also having an leader with the trait expertise materials also helps more (Fixed an issue with a NOT where it should be a NOR)
- Stations give sublight speed, winddown, windup aura per station level. 20-> 40%
- Tech slider interval to 5% from 25%
- Vassal Changes: CB last 100 years from 1. You can demand vassal / tribute from anyone. Does not matter how strong they are anymore.


# Tests To-Do
- Increase planet size in galaxy generation to at least 12
- Increase homeworld planet generation to at least 18
- Disable total war
- Federation status without fed fleet
- Remove Defense platoform upkeep (prob not duable due to how power is calculated)
- Make commuincatons have a countdown timer to limit how often they can demand tribute/insult things so it is not spammable.


# Future Tests - Need more knowledge
- Setup a VS arena map (Test run complete but won't load with 2.2 due to tile changes)
- Modify wormhole tech to be researchable after seeing a wormhole
